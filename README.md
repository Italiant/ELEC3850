# Autonomous Vehicle Project
## Part A
- From a given start location, travel in a straight line towards a wall and stop at a set distance from the wall. Time between starting and stopping as well as the amount of error in the stop location will be measured and used to determine a grade.
- Navigate a small rectangular course, which may contain obstacles. The car is required to start and stop at the same location. The time to navigate the course and distance from the desired stopping point will be used to determine and used to determine a grade.
## Part B: Enhanced Car Control
The basic functions to be considered in the design of the Enhanced Car Control system are:
- Cruise Control
- Hill Hold
- Adaptive Cruise Control
- Self (reverse) Park
- Lane keeping assist
- Navigation
